# NASxIF Summer School 2022



Quantum Information are on Thursday 2 and 9 June. We will have a total of 8 one-and-a-half-hour lecture sessions and 2 tutorial sessions.

## Resources

* [Zw] Barton Zwiebach's [lecture notes for MIT8.05 Quantum Physics II](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013/pages/lecture-notes/), 2013
* [Ha] Aram Harrow's [lecture notes for MIT8.06 Quantum Physics III](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-06-quantum-physics-iii-spring-2016/pages/lecture-notes/), 2016
* [SW] Benjamin Schumacher and Michael Westmoreland, *Quantum Processes, Systems, & Information*, Cambridge University Press, 2010
* [Pr] John Preskill, [lecture notes for Ph219/CS219 Quantum Computation](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/index.html), Caltech
* [NC] Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang, *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information*, Cambridge University Press, 2000
<!--* [Fu] Keisuke Fujii, "Stabilizer Formalism and Its Applications" in *Quantum Computing with Topological Codes*, Springer, 2015-->

The first three references are undergraduate level. The first one especially is for those who are not familiar with quantum mechanics in linear-algera style (for example, those who have only seen quantum mechanics from Griffiths' book.)

<!--## Course description
Quantum information science capitalizes on quantum weirdness. In these lectures, I will eventually focus on a particular application of quantum weirdness: quantum computing. The goal is to show you that primitives from quantum information theory such as teleportation can be applied in an interesting way.
